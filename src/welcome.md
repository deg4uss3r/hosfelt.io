# Welcome
My name is Ricky and welcome to my Markdown blog! 

I built this site to share some technical writings and play around with fun things. I used `mdbook` to build this blog [found here](https://github.com/azerupi/mdBook) it is pretty awesome and written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)!

Stay tunned for more, and hopefully a less corny about me section.
